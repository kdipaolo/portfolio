The contractors application was built for an internal team at Procter & Gamble. The app helps manage a database of contractors and handles any requests for contractors that come in through the application. A typical user would go into the app and submit a request for work from a contractor. Then an administrator would get notified of the request and take action of approving or declining the request based on the information submitted. This application takes advantage of the SharePoint REST API to pull in data and also manipulate data.
