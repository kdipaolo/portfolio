The Family Challenge Application was built to help solve the problem of parents getting their kids to do their chores. A parent has the ability to create an account with the application, add members to their family, create tasks for those members, assign due dates to those tasks, and create a reward for the members to receive if all tasks are complete. The member of the family has the ability to create an account and see the tasks that are relevant to them, the due data, and ability to communicate back and forth with a parent.
