Bid like a boss is a virtual personal assistant for any construction contract professional. The app gives the user the ability to fill out a contractor calculator, where they fill out 5 questions about their project, they are given an estimate filled out with trades, tasks, and financial values associated with those tasks. From there a user must create an account to interact and edit their estimate. As a user they are able to create estimates, manage their clients, and edit their company info. From there, if they want to create a professional looking proposal, they must sign up with a “pro” account. The app collects their payment info via the Stripe API and processes it giving them access to create proposals based off of their estimates and export them to their potential customers.
